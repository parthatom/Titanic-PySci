# Titanic-PySci
Kaggle's Titanic with Pytorch and sci-kit learn

Data handling, cleaning and feature selection has been performed, before using machine learning techniques.

The notebook contained in this repository employs two different methods:
* A 3-layer neural network coded in Pytorch
* A second more "data scientist"'s method, to compare machine learning models from sklearn (and xgboost).

The second method has been written such that it can be used as a template for a lot of projects.

The final submission was made using the neural network's prediction, which shows the power of neural network.
